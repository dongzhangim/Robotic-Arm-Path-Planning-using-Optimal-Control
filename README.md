# EEE587-Final-Project

This repository contains the files created for EEE587 Optimal Control (Spring 2020) Final Project at ASU

## TEAM MEMBERS: Siddhartha Cheruvu, Aaron Arul Maria John, Lei Zhang

## Tools Used: MATLAB, Peter Corke's Toolbox



## INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE CODE

The MATLAB code created uses Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox. Hence, the first step is to install the add-on in MATLAB.

Navigate to 'Add-on' explorer from the 'Home' ribbon of MATLAB. 

Search 'Peter Corke' and from the results install 'Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB'.

Then, download the 'Code' folder from this repository. The files can then be run directly without any additional support.

Comments are added in the files to clearly explain the algorithm.

## FILES

The `Code` folder contains the following files.
* `Value_Iteration_2Link_Arm.m`
* `Value_Iteration_2Link_with_Obstacles.m`
* `Value_Iteration_3Link_Arm.m`
* `Value_Iteration_3Link_with_Obstacles.m`
* `Policy_Iteration_2Link_with_Obstacles.m`
